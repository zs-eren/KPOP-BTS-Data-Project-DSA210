# KPOP-BTS-Data-Project-DSA210

INTRO

K-pop today is far more than a music genre; it has grown into an enormous digital culture that reaches millions across the world. Within this global movement, BTS stands out as one of the strongest driving forces. Because of this trying to understand BTS’s popularity is essentially the same as trying to understand how modern digital culture works and how big online engagement is formed.

As BTS grows globally, both the performance of their music videos and their online engagement increased significantly over time. Each music video (MV) release when considered together with factors such as comeback timing, online fan reactions, and global search interest, creates a measurable cycle of interest. This cycle is shaped by viewer growth rates, like rates, comment density, trending trends, and release strategies. All these factors combine to form a complex yet fascinating success model that can be analyzed with data science to understand how BTS's global popularity was created and how it has changed over time.

This project aims to examine BTS's global engagement model from a data science perspective. By analyzing a wealth of data, from music video performances and trend waves to the rate of like growth and comment density, I aim to uncover the key drivers of popularity with using both visualizations, statistical methods, and machine learning models, I want to show by the numbers why BTS has such a strong global impact
